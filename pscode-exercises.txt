// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Type a number in each to find the sum:

number1 = "2"
number2 = "6"
number1 (2) + number2 (6) = 8.

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

number = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

if number = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
	print("Even number.")
else:
	print("Odd number.")

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) number = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
b) total = 15
c, d) if number = 1
	print("minimum")
if number = 5
	print("maximum")
